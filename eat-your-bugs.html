    <h1>Eat Your Bugs!</h1>

      <p>Covid. Mad Cow. Chicken Flu. All came from animals.</p>

<p>Things that are related to us, the things that we generally eat, can transmit things to us because they have similar genetics.</p>

<p>Insects are unlikely to do that, they’re likely to be much more healthy, both because of that and because of their nutrition. They have less bones and inedible matter, they’re just basically a raw protein.
