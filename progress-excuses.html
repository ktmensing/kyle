    <h1>Progress vs. Excuses</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.humblethepoet.com/" target="_blank">Humble the Poet</a> was on the <a href="https://www.richroll.com/podcast/humble-the-poet-461/" target="_blank">Rich Roll podcast</a> dropping knowledge bombs.</p>
<p>Including:</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3>If you're not making progress, you're making excuses.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm practically en expert on procrastinating and making grand plans with very little in the way of action so this hit home. It was also a great kick in the ass and reminder to do soemthing, anything.</p>
<p>You don't have to finish in one go. One day. All at once.</p>
<p>Even 1% is progress. And progress compounds, so 1% daily over time is a big deal.</p>
<h4>Will you make progress or excuses today?</h4>
