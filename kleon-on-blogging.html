    <h1>Blogging Forgiveness</h1>

      <p>At one point I used the tagline "learning in public & thinking out loud" for my blog.</p>
      <p>This is how I view the exercise of blogging. It is the ultimate ownership medium on the web. You stake your claim, plant your flag, and slowly iterate your way to some semblance of a style or focus.</p>
      <p>I am currently drafting this post in real time. I doubt I will read it back or make significant edits. I am thinking onto my keyboard and will post this thought process to the world wide web. The wonder of technology.</p>
      <p>I also see changing one's mind as a sign of growth. (At least when done in response to learning more or having an experience. Not as a solely people-pleasing mechanism.) We are very rarely 100% right the first time. We should both acknowledge and embrace that fact.</p>
      <p>Stong opinions, weakly held.</p>
      <p>All this to say, I enjoyed reading Austin Kleon's post on <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/09/blogging-as-a-forgiving-medium/" target="_blank">Blogging as a Forgiving Medium</a>.</p>
      <blockquote><em>"But most importantly, I want to be able to be wrong. I want to change my mind! I want to evolve."</em> </blockquote>
      <p>The ability to revise and revisit. Reflect and reshape. Retool. Is critical to our abilites to both grow and hone in on various areas of interest or importance to us. I don't know of another way to do this than to write stuff down and revisit as needed. You don't need to do this publically&mdash;it can be a journal or private doc&mdash;but some of us apparently want more attention, so there's blogging.</p>
