    <h1>Burning Time</h1>

      <p>Fossil fuels are called that because it is what they are made out of. Fossils. The remains of something once living.</p>
      <p>I heard an interesting spin on this via <a href="https://shows.acast.com/teamhuman/episodes/tyson-yunkaporta" target="_blank">Douglas Rushkoff's Team Human podcast episode with Tyson Yunkaporta.</a> (<a href="https://overcast.fm/+G_9i_hGzI/50:48" target="_blank">here's a timestamped Overcast link.</a>)</p>
      <p>Our progression along the continuum of energy sources has been further and further into the past.</p>
      <p>First hundreds of years with wood.</p>
      <p>Then thousands with coal.</p>
      <p>Then tens of thousands with dinosaurs.</p>
      <p>Then in the millions or more with uranium.</p>
      <p>In this context, many renewable energy sources make complete sense as our next primary source. They are older still (except maybe uranium).</p>
      <p>Now is also the perfect time to celebrate the sun and wind and rain.</p>
      <p>Happy Spring</p>
